Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI, GenAI,[1] or GAI) is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data.[2][3][4] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data[5][6] based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts.[7][8]

Improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), enabled an AI boom of generative AI systems in the early 2020s. These include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and LLaMA; text-to-image artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video AI generators such as Sora.[9][10][11][12] Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models.[7][13][14]

Generative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service,[15] sales and marketing,[16] art, writing,[17] fashion,[18] and product design.[19] However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative AI such as cybercrime, the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people, and the mass replacement of human jobs.[20][21] Intellectual property law concerns also exist around generative models that are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art.[22]
